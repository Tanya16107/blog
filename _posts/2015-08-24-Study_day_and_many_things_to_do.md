We started the week working in the sidebar task.
Later, we studied Ruby and JavaScript, and we read and investigated to solve some doubt in order to do this task

The afternoon consisted in reading and analyzing code, and we wrote to our mentor asking him about the other task that we are doing: show and hide code examples.

Also, tomorrow we will start attending a ruby workshop at our coaching company.
