We woke up with our post published in the blog of RGSoC; yes today we had a great awakening.

During the first hours of the day, we read the answer of our mentor for the problem that we have with the search-box to filter the elements that we need to show. Attending his feedback, we tried to think a new way to solve the problem.

Later, we have the standup with our coaches and we explained them the ideas we had thought. After a long standup with many ideas and possibles solutions, we ended up with two options, but we weren't sure if any of them will really work.

The afternoon consisted in doing tests and more tests.

We continue with a solution for the moment :(

Finally, to close the week, we attended do the Crowd's badges ceremony, an event to recognize coworkers with rewards, food and drinks.
