Today was a great and tiring day. We started our day with the notice of the [merge of our first task](https://github.com/livingstyleguide/livingstyleguide/issues/24#event-363377480) and this is included in the new [version of the gem](https://github.com/livingstyleguide/livingstyleguide/releases/tag/v2.0.0.alpha.9)

In the morning, we finished the first post for our Blog and on it we talked about the first weeks in the Summer of Code and the Open Source project in which we are working. Also, we have wrote the post in English and Spanish as well.

We continued resolving some problems with the code of our Blog to publish it finally, and also the post we had wrote.

Later, we have written to the Media and Content Chief of the Living Style Guide gem, Jen, we would like to have her support to check the grammar of our post.

And sure, today we have investigated more about the copy button task and how to do it, and we reviewed the part of code that we could reuse inside the gem, also we were selecting which of our tests we can reuse to play with our new code. We think that tomorrow will be a full day of testing codeâ€¦
