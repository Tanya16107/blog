Our day has been full of studying and doing examples with Sinatra:

We have practiced the routing methods.
We learned how to use curl.

We have discovered how to see all the request details, responses, etc in the network panel of chrome developer tools.

All of these will help us build our next task which will be a live editor for livingstyleguide, we think this is a project by itself so we will divide it into small tasks
