We published our first post yesterday at night, and for that reason we started the day with the daily standup to define and clarify the details to correct in our blog, and we determined in what we should be working today.
After, we wrote some emails to the Living Style Guideâ€™s Media and Content Chief, she gave us feedback about our first post.

We translated the second post to English and we began to write the post for the Rails Girls blog. Also, we continued studying Rails, Ruby and Markdown.

And finally, we attended the CSS and SMACSS course.
