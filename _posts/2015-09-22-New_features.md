Today we had continued working in the Living Style Guide editor adding new features, we think that is important to allow the user to query documentation without losing focus of the editor and being able to type in it at the same time, so we have dedicated part of our day to implement this:  
- Add a button to toggle documentation section.
   -  Implement tabs with bootstrap to switch between help topics, in the process we learned how to embed a template within another template in sinatra using

            <%= erb :<template name> %>
