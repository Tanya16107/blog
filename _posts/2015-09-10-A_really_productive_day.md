We were working in the live editor all day long.

In past days, we did the first steps and We had achieved how to generate a style guide in one page with another extension.

Today, we have been working to the style guide generator we use the iframe approach. We needed to research differents terms and concepts to do this first part of the task:

- preventDefault method.  
- createElement method to include and insert an iframe.  
- XMLHttpRequest object, to can receive data.  
- JSON  
- AJAX  
- createTextNode, appendChild and innerHTMLmethods.  
- sync and async.  

And now, We can present a bit of the live editor, that already generates the style guide inside the iframe. =)
