Today, over everything we were working on documentation for the living style guide live editor:

As we mentioned yesterday, we have added two more features related to documentation, small blocks of help text that will allow you to get started with concepts and living style guide features and some tips in a challenge format.
Add icons to the documentation and challenges buttons, to better express their functionality using font-awesome library.

Finally, we have done a functionality to load examples from the documentation into the editor when clicking over them.
