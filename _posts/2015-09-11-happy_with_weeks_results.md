Today in our standup, we discussed about fixing some errors with our javascript code

- We fixed adding multiple iframes when submitting more than one time the form.

- We escaped the LSG code sent to sinatra, as some symbols where not supported like the percentage symbol.

- Finally we started adding some styling to our editor, but itâ€™s still a work in progress.
