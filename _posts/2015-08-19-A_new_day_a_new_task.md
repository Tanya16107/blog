The day started with our weekly call to our supervisor Katrin, we talked to her about the official RGSoC day-off and the work we have done last week and what we will do in this week.  

We added descriptions to our pull-requests for livingstyleguide (the ones merged yesterday)

We had another weekly call with our mentor Nico, we talked about how to do our next task and planned what to do later, we looked at some legacy code which we will be using for one of our next tasks: add buttons to show and hide code blocks in style guides with code examples.

We also studied Javascript, and we are planning to attend a couple workshops about Ruby, Sinatra and Testing.
