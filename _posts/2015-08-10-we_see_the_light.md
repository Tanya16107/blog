We stared the week with a message from our mentor Nico. He told us that he would be merging our pull request for the copy buttons.

We continued with the search task and we now have some progress. The markdown gem used by Living Style Guide to generate the html document does not allows us to change its structure to group headers and other content elements to ease the search. We believe that we have found the way to solve our problem: we are using 'nextSibling' and 'nextElementSibling' to display related elements.

Also, we improved our blog and we included our daily logs in [it](http://code.fanxhe.com/categories/daily-log-rgsoc.html)

Finally, today we had our standup at the end of the day
