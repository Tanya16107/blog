Today is Wednesday and this means that has been a day in which we have the call with our supervisor Katrin but in the morning we have received the notice that she is sick :( , and Ramon will be our supervisor until she feels better :) .

In our call we also had news , our coach Jonathan is not feeling well too :( and our coworker Gilberto will join us for the rest of the summer :).

After we had our standup, we decided what to do :

- Add some styling to our editor.
- Avoid redirecting to the style guide when we generate it, we want to show the result next to our editor, using javascript and ajax.
We are happy because we have some progress :).
