To start the morning we had our stand-up and we defined the tasks to work and clarify doubts about the process to build a living style guide live editor.

Later, we made a simple app and we got it working, now, our little editor generates style guides based on livingstyleguide code submitted through a text-area form.

The afternoon consisted of installing and adding twitter bootstrap styling to our editor.

Also, we studied about:

Sinatra (servers and routes)
Git commands.
Finally, we planned how we will structure and design our live editor.
