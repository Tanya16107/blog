Our day has begun with news from our mentor Nico, he made a new code review for the search bar pull request, and left some feedback, then we started to work.

We fix some details in the css added to position the search-box to the right.

Our mentor asked us to work in one last requirement, to add the search-box as a filter in the livingstyleguide gem, to make it optional, and after an explanation we were hands on, and now you can use it as the following:

    @search-box

This will add a search box on top of the style guide which filters the content via JavaScript.
You can also customize (e.g. translate) the placeholder for the search box:

    @search-box placeholder: buscar

By the way, Nico has merged our remaining pull requests today :), and tomorrow he will release a new version of livingstyleguide which will include them, we are very happy!

Also, we published our second blog post, itâ€™s about our copying colors from the color swatches examples task.

Later we had a planning session in which we discussed about which tasks we would work next.
