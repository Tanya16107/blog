The day has started with tests of our code in internet explorer , we tested that the help text for copying doesn’t appear if browser doesn’t support the copy functionality, and we did it. =)
When we finished it, our team had standup, and we defined the new tasks for today. After, we updated our pull-request description in [GitHub](https://github.com/livingstyleguide/livingstyleguide/pull/143),  and we wrote to our mentor to communicate him that we finished the task and we had the pull-request ready for another review.
