Our day started reading an article about copy commands,  because we are going to do the task to add copy buttons for the color examples in living style guides.  

We continued with our daily standup, and today it was too important, as we had many doubts about how we would start the task.  

Later, we had a class about the structure of the gem reading the code of our gem. We needed to know where we will add the code that will generate the buttons to copy colors.   
We read about javascript functions to find elements (html and css) . Also studied  some Ruby core classes and their instance and global methods used in livingstyleguide's gem.  

Finally, we used the colors  example generated with livingstyleguide previously and we added a javascript code to copy colors on click.  

Moreover, today is the birthday of Steffi, and crowd interactive and co-workers didn't forget to congratulate her. :smiley:
