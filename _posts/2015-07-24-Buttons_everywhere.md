Yes, today has been full of buttons everywhere. In the morning, we began with the new task to add buttons in the code examples so we can copy the code appearing in JavaScript, Coffe-Script, J-query, HTML and HAML.

We reused part of the code that we used for the copy colors task, and added new javascript code and we refactored our code.

Later, we had the daily standup with our coaches:
we resolved doubts
we came to agreements

We worked in our blog so we can publish the first post in it.
Before end of morning, we finished the part of javascript code for the copy buttons and in the afternoon we continued with the css code for it. However, we had some problems with a SVG image for the background of the button, but…. finally we resolved the problem and we did our [second pull request](https://github.com/livingstyleguide/livingstyleguide/pull/157)

End of release… and… happy weekend for everyone!!
