We started the day with our standup and today, we talked about the gem and the task to add copy buttons to colors. Yesterday, while we were testing we had doubts about if we are going to apply the copy button to the color variable, the hexadecimal color code or both. We asked our mentor Nico, to solve this question before continue.

After, we did to many tests,  we had a few problems, but .... finally we have done our first commit and pull-request !! =)
