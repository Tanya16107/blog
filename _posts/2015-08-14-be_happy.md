Today we awoke with news from our mentor Nico, he gave us feedback about our search bar task, then we studied his code suggestions, and we saw everything more clear.

After that, we had our daily stand up and we did a plan for the day:

First, we continued studying about Javascript , Git and Sass through CodeSchool.

Secondly, we studied and observed a Javascript coding style guide about that Nico recommend us.

In the third place, we did some changes to our search bar code, we refactored ( cleaned code, renamed variables and removed repeated and not needed parts) and we sent this change to our [latest github pull request](https://github.com/livingstyleguide/livingstyleguide/pull/160)

Finally , went to the crowdâ€™s weekly meeting.

Have a good weekend, everybody :).
