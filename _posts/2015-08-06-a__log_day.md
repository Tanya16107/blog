Our day began reviewing some comments about our post for the RGSoC blog. After that, we corrected these small details. We had the Standup and we discussed the task to do. We are having some difficulties to find the way to show, exactly, what we want:

-We have searched and reviewed different methods in JS to select the part of the HTML that we need
  * .getElementsByTagName
  * .getElementByClassName
  * .querySelectorAll
  * .getElementById
At the moment, we didn't find the solution
  * We thought other alternatives:

    * Add other div with a class
    * Search a Tag and search its siblings (But returns an object and not an element)

With all this ideas that we had, we did tests.

Then we sent the last commits to our pull-request about the post for Rails Girls and, finally we studied and read about JS, HTML and Ruby.

We are so tired, but tomorrow it's going to be another day.
