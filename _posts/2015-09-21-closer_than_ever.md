In the next days we are going to finish our summer of code participation, we are near to finish our last task.
In the morning we had our stand-up, where we talked about the topics to investigate and work today, so we were working to include and implement the ace editor in our live editor.
Also, we have investigated and decided how we are going to do the documentation for the editor, and for that we thought in the user usability:
-Input checkbox, label and CSS attribute checked.
-Bootstrap collapse.

Finally, we talked about the content and the structure for our next blog post for RGSoC.
