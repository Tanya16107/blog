Our day started working in the hover effect for the color swatch examples, which is the visual part of our first task.

We had some doubts about using transparency in SCSS, but we were able to solve this problem using the transparentize sass mixin and we created other commits for this.

After that, we sent a message to our mentor Nico to define how we will add a hint text when hover effect is activated.

We had our daily standup.

Thanks to our mentor, we were able to continue with our task, we inserted a html div in a erb template, adding new conditions.
