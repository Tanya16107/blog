First in the morning we start with our standup where we talked about the achieves already made, the tasks that we have to do during the day and the improvements we need to do for the live editor.

In addition, we had the weekly call with our supervisor Ramon, and we showed him the progress of our work. As well we schedule with our mentor the next call with  him.

We continue working with the task/feature live editor, we added more default examples that we want to show when the page loads
