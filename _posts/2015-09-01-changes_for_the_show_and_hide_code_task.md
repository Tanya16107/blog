We started the day with our daily standup :) , and we did a plan to tackle the feedback changes for the show and hide code task:

- We used localstorage instead of cookies.  
- We used only one variable for toggle-code and its button.  
- We changed filter name to toggle-code.  
- We refactored classes names in css and javascript to show code by default.  
- We added var prefix to variables.  
- We added lsg prefix to CSS classes.  

After, we were studying Ruby and Sinatra.
