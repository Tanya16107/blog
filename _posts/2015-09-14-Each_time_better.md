Today, we continued working on the live editor to LSG code and we did some progress:

- We finished the style of the button to convert from LSG code to style guide, but we still want to add an effect.
- We included style in the header.
- We did changes in the JS script to do the request asynchronous and display error if request fails, for that we read and researched about 'onreadystatechange'
- Also, we include some examples to show when the page loads. At the moment, we did the colors example. To complete this task we have to search and studied how to include variables in Sinatra, and how we are going to show those examples randomly.
