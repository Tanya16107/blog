We have begun the day with our daily standup and we did the plan for the rest day.  

According to the plan, our coach showed us the structure of a gem and also the livingstyleguide gem’s structure , now we understand it better :) :) and we learned new git commands.

After that we continued studying and researching about the livingstyleguide gem and tested it.  

Before, we went out for lunch we are played Nintendo64 (Super Smash Bros):)

When we returned to the office, we asked questions about our doubts and our coach continued explaining  the livingstyleguide gem’s source code.

We finished the day studying and doing more tests.

We are very happy because, we now understand better the structure of a gem and also the livingstyleguide gem’s structure.
