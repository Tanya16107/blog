To start the day,  we had a call with our supervisor Katrin - K, she congratulated us for our work,  and we are very happy to see our work reflected. We also continued with our standup and made plans about the tasks that we would work on.
Before lunch, we investigated about next tasks and we wrote down questions to our mentor and later we continued studying a course of CodeSchool.
In the afternoon,  our team had  a call with our mentor Nico Hagenburger and he communicated us that our work was well, and we talked about our next objective.

The next task will consist in insert buttons to copy HTML, HAML, etc , code examples.
After  we worked in our future blog post in which we wrote about our experience with the livingstyleguideâ€™s gem. We believe that doing a compilation of information is very important to continue with our work.
