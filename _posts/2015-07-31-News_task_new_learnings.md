A new Friday, that started solving the problem that we had with the task about copy code:
we could solved the problem and fix the tests, so we did a new commit to our pull-request related to this task.

We needed to search more info in order to start the new task and for that we studied and read about it:

 * [Keyboard events, specifically, about keydown and key press](  http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html)
 * [Key event properties as keyCode and charCode](    http://javascript.info/tutorial/keyboard-events/)

At midday, we had the standup and we asked our coaches about the doubts we had arisen to read different articles about the theme and we defined the best form to implement the searchBox.

Before, we begin the task, we have created a document with all the availables examples in the gem: Colors, fonts, code (JS, HTML, HAML, Coffe-Script), markdown â€¦
Also, we have got to advance so much with the task, we added:

* Buttons
* Event click
* regExp

And now, the blocks of code that haven't been searched in the Search Box are hidden.

Moreover, today was the last day of the CSS and SMACSS workshop, and we learned about responsive pages.
