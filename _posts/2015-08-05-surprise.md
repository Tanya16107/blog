We prepared a surprise … for our introduction Rails Girls Summer of Code blog post. Later, we had the weekly call with our supervisor Katrin, and we explained to her the tasks, activities and the workshop that we attended last week, and we also talked and explained our plans for this week.

Then:

  *  We had our standup: we clarified doubts about the search box task. We need to solve some details in the code.
  *  We continued doing corrections in our blog post.
  *   We studied: Git, HTML,SASS and JavaScript.
  *   We attended a show-dont-tell talk at the company.
  *   We forked the summer of code blog repository and we wrote in it our introduction post and we added some styling.
  *  We selected and added some photos for the blog post.
  *  We prepared a surprise.
  *  We continued with the search box task, but we haven’t found the solution yet.
  *  Finally we opened a pull-request with our blog post.
