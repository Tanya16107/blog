The new week started reviewing and remembering the tasks that we are currently working. The last Friday we sent a pull request for the toggle code task and we almost finished the navigation menu task.

In the morning, we added a little modification in the style for the menu and we shared a commit url to our mentor so he can check it out and give us feedback about our progress.

During the afternoon, the mentor gave us feedback about the toggle code task, and we have to work on:

- Using localStorage instead of cookies.  
- Refactoring  
- Adding a test for it  

Later, we investigated about how can we implement the localStorage feature and we planned how we will do our test.
