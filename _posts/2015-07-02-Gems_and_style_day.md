We started our day by having a daily standup, we talked about what we did yesterday and what we will be doing today.

Then, we continued working on a article list view for our blog, and we had a problem with the computer we were for pairing, we had it replaced and installed and configure our computer again :(.

Today was the birthday of a partner at Crowd Interactive and we ate cheesecake =). It is a great tradition in the company.

We continued our day installing the livingstyleguide gem, and did some examples before we generate a style guide for our own team blog.
