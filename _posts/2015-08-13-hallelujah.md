Yes!! finally, we did it. :)

We had a great day, because we could solve the problem that we had with our task and finish it :). The true is that we have learned so much doing the search-bar.

At midday, we talked with our mentor and we showed him a example and, apparently, all is fine.

We sent a new commit to our pull-request.

The afternoon was more relaxed and we studied about:

- Git commands
- JavaScript
- SASS.
