We started our day with the call to our supervisor Katrin. After, we continued with the task about the copy buttons, we needed to add a small change in the code.  

Also, we were in the Show Don't Tell session with the winner Gophergala solo app, JÃ¶el Stemmer who is visiting Crowd Interactive
He is from Netherlands and he has created an app called rehook for reviewing requests from external web services (like GitHub).
We did some CodeSchool and read about Ruby and JavaScript.  

In the afternoon, we had a call with our mentor Nico and he approved the code for the task. Now, we are going to add a functionality to the copy event and CSS code for the visual part of it.
