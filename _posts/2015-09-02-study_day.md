We have dedicated the day to study different topics that we need to know to do our next task. We studied about :

- Ruby (methods, hashes, instance variables, optional arguments, attr_accessors, splat operators, etc).  
- Sinatra (http verbs, basics)  
- JavaScript (hoisting, variable function expressions, returns).  

Also, we planned the next post for our blog.
