Today was a day of saying good bye, but it was also a hard working day. We had two tasks pending regarding our work on the Living Style Guide’s gem:

Add navigation menu
Add button to toggle code block visibility
But, to finish both tasks, we suggested our mentor to reorganize the way we use scripts, and add two more filters, before and after.

We worked in some feedback changes from yesterday, on the navigation menu and the scripts reorganization pull requests, so part of our day consisted in finishing them and the other part in working on adding the before and after filters, and a few tests.

We had our last call with our supervisor, and we also gave a talk at our coaching company office, for our coworkers, showcasing what we have been working in these last three months. It was a very busy day for us, and even when our summer of code ends today maybe we didn’t feel like it that much, because for us, it’s not ending yet, as we have a few pending tasks.
