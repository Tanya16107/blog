After a fun and relax day off, on a pool, we continued our last week day looking forward to complete our dynamic navigation menu code, as we mentioned before we're trying to make it as a dropdown, to show headlines and sub headlines, etc. Well, we finally were able to build the html structure with ruby, we still need to clean it up and refactor it, we realized we might have went ahead with this idea, but it helped us to practice a complex loop and conditions with ruby, we'll see if we can improve it and hopefully use it, because right now we're trying to find the right effect for it, we're now experimenting with a hover, but before we follow with this further, we are going to ask our mentor for this.

Have a happy weekend! :)
