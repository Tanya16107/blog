We had did many differents things today. Firstly, we continued solving some details in our blog with the image and positions. Since we had to attend the CSS and SMACSS course, now we know that we need refactor the CSS code:

We want to convert CSS to SASS (It is more clearly and useful).
We want to apply SMACSS rules in the page.
We need make the page responsive.
We included code in Jekyll to use categories and include our daily logs. More Later, we started to investigate the new task: we have to add a search bar for we can search content, text and code examples, and we almost solved the problem with our previous task.

To wrap up the day, we attended the CSS and SMACSS workshop.

Has been a tired day, but we are really learning so much, and we are happy and satisfied because we are completing our tasks.
