Wednesday, the day that we talked to our supervisor Katrin, of this way we started our day. We talked with to about all the work that we did the last week, how we feel about having published of our first blog post in our blog, the first post for the Rails Girls Blog and what we want to do and what are we are going to do this week.

Nico, our mentor, explained to us what we have to solve in our last pull-request, and later during our standup we talked about how would we solve it and the tasks to complete today.
Throughout the day, we sent to the Media and Content Chief our second post for our blog, we asked her to support us reviewing it. Also we updated our trello, and organized some of the next tasks.  

 We almost finished the post for Rails Girls, but we have thought about adding something originalâ€¦. Surprise, surprise.

We studied more about Rails, Ruby, Markdown and JavaScript during the afternoon. We solved some problems with the google analytics configuration our blog, we reduced the size of the principal image and now our page is more light, and we added a new image too, this image is great news for us: we have a logo for the team !!

The logo was made by our designer, a coworker at Crowd Interactive.
Finally, we attended to  the CSS and SMACSS  course in our Coach Company: Crowd Interactive. You can see here: https://github.com/ingilniero/smacss-workshop
