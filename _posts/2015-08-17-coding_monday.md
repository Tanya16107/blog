We have started the week, with a stand - up remembering what was remaining to do and then we began with it:

- We added scss to the search bar.
- We fixed some problems with the spaces in the code.
- We looked at a problem with duplicated code that our mentor had mentioned to us, then we detected it and changed it.
- We tried to reproduce an error with the copy button.
