We started the day doing some tests with the code that we had located yesterday. This code is necessary to do one of our next tasks: hide/show code blocks, this feature already existed but it stopped working at some time, we investigated how it works, and how to deal with cookies because we havenâ€™t used them before we made it work using a local server.

Also, we shared some ideas with Nico and other collaborator about our other task:

Generate a navigation-bar for the style guides.
