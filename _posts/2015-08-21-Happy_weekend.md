This morning we started our day with our standup, then we shared our findings about our current tasks: show and hide buttons for code examples and generate a navigation bar, and we discussed some ideas about both tasks:  


- show/hide code blocks:  
    - Doing a global button to toggle all code blocks or have a button for each code block.
    - We could use a filter
    Cookies usage  
- generate navigation bar:  
    - How to generate a link for every headline, subheadline, etc.
    - We have researched and analyzed code
    - We identified where this can be done
    - We could use another filter  

During the rest of the day were playing with the code, trying to generate a collection of links for every section, and we did it. Then we are now looking how to include them in the generated style guide.

Have a happy weekend.
