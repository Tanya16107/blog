Our week has started with a standup, in which we have done a summary of our progress from the last week.

We were studying very much to do our next task, and we are ready to begin with it:

- We created a test sinatra app in which we could type things in a form

- We have created a submit button to send code

- We display a result based on the input.

Today we have done little progress about our next task, and we have a lot of work ahead:

We should be able to type LSG code, submit it to the Sinatra app when pressing a form button and then generate and show the resulting style guide
