We have begun our day with a standup, in it we talked about the feedback that our mentor gave us and we did a task plan.

Before we started working we had to pull livingstyleguide latest changes, to do it we rebased our work on top of v2 branch, and resolved some conflicts, with merge tool with the help of our coaches.

Latter we continued with our tasks:

Changed hard coded values by variables.
Removed console.log from javascript code.
We removed top and height of the hover span.
Fix broken tests.
Also, we did some changes to our code, to enable the copy functionality only when the browser supports it.
