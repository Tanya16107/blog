We did more and more work on the search-box task. Everytime time we are near to solve the problem another one appears.

During the day we read and studied about:

- JS: methods as Array.filter, Array.indexOf and also about NodeLists.  
We started using [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net), it's very useful.

- HTML
- Ruby and Rails

We believe and hope to be near to cover all the search matches. Tomorrow will be working on it more.
