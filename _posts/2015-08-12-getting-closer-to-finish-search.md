The day started with a call to our supervisor Katrin, we told her about what  we have been doing to finish the search task, the difficult parts and the parts that are ready. During the day we tried to finish the task and we got closer to finish it.

Also at midday we attended  to the company's show don't tell session, and we heard two talks, one about  *Mobile responsiveness* and another about a ruby [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-categorizer) - [jekyll-categorizer](https://github.com/joiggama/jekyll-categorizer) (this one by our coach Nacho).

We hope to finish this task early tomorrow, so  we can continue with another one. We know we can do it.
