Our Monday began working back on LivingStyleGuide's gem, we decided to finalize one of the past tasks “Show and hide code bocks (tooggle code)” :

- First, we fixed a bug incorrectly checking a hideCode variable in localStorage
- Secondly, we renamed the filter file from showhide to togglecode
- Third, we did a test that was pending
- Fourth, we have created another branch to join every javascript into one template, to fix a problem that we noticed in our previous test.
- Finally, we’ve tried to do another test to the other previously added filter search-box, but we couldn’t do it yet.
