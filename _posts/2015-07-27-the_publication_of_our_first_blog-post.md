The week has begun with a standup, in which the members of the team agreed on what we would spend our day, and we decided to use part of the day to solve some responsiveness problems and prepare our Jekyll blog to publish the blog post that we wrote the last week.

[our first post](http://code.fanxhe.com/blog/2015-07-28-the_beginning_of_the_adventure.html)

Also, we have been preparing a brain-storming document for our first rails girls blog post :)

To finalize the afternoon we attended a CSS and SMACSS course facilitated by a coworker at Crowd Interactive and thanks to this we could understand and learn more good practices. Good news: our coworker will teach us during all the week!

Moreover, the moment to start investigating and study the next task is nearâ€¦ search bar here we go ;)
