During the day we were working and investigating about our current two tasks: generate a navigation menu and show and hide code examples.

Early in the morning we had our standup and we planned the activities and things to work today.

We started and finished our day working in the menu and we achieved some advances, we are able to generate all the menu items, now we are trying to group headlines with their sub-headlines, to build a dropdown menu.

We also worked in the button to show and hide code examples, and it is almost finished.
